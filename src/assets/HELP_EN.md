Here are some information that may help you to use the App.

### The App is empty. Refreshing doesn't work.

- First, go to `Change Current Semester` in `Settings` to make sure you have selected the correct semester you want. Summer semesters sometimes make the App blank since there may be no courses.
- Please Try to `Logout` in `Settings` and re-login.

### iOS: The file won't open. / The file is always blank.

- This is possibly due to any download failure. Please tap the Refresh button on the upper right or use `Clear File Cache` in `Settings` to clear file cache. The App will try to download the file again.
- Please also check the file format. Some formats are not supported on iOS WebView, such as `.zip`, `.rar` and so on. Please tap the `share` button on the upper right the screen to share the file to other apps that support these formats.

### Android: Tapping on the file doesn't do anything.

- This is possibly due to any download failure. Please tap the Refresh button in the center or use `Clear File Cache` in `Settings` to clear file cache. The App will try to download the file again.
- Please also check the file size. It takes longer to download large files and there is possibility that the download will fail.

### iOS: There are multiple calendar events in my Calendar.

- Please go to `Calendar & Reminders` in `Settings` and click `Delete Synced Calendars & Reminders`.
